## Completed This Session (2026-02-11)

- [x] Built debug APK via Gradle — BUILD SUCCESSFUL (93 tasks)
- [x] Tested Android app in emulator (Medium_Phone_API_36.1, API 36)
- [x] Generated custom app icons for Android (12 sizes, ldpi→xxxhdpi, square + round) and iOS
- [x] Generated custom splash screens — full-bleed design (logo fills entire screen)
  - Android: 13 sizes (portrait + landscape, ldpi→xxxhdpi)
  - iOS: 3 sizes (@1x, @2x, @3x universal)
- [x] Created assets/ folder as canonical source for icons + splash (icon-only.png, splash.png)
- [x] ResourceCard: "View Implant Info" → "Additional Implant Information"
- [x] SuggestedResourcesModal: grouped by specialty/subspecialty with counters (super_admin and specialty_admin views)
- [x] TermsAcceptanceModal: Back button + Decline button added (Back returns to onboarding; Decline signs out)
- [x] Podiatry renamed "Podiatric Surgery" + subtitle in Onboarding and SettingsModal

- [x] SettingsModal: user type change dropdown added
- [x] Security hardening: allowlist validation added for surgeon onboarding options and user type update

## Completed This Session (2026-02-09)
- [x] Restored working Google Calendar OAuth (was broken by failed Supabase Vault attempt)
- [x] Implemented AES-256-GCM application-level token encryption in all 4 Edge Functions
- [x] Added access_token_iv / refresh_token_iv columns to user_calendar_connections
- [x] Stored TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY as Supabase secret
- [x] Fixed calendar event end time bug (slice 0,16 → 0,19 was causing 400 from Google API)
- [x] Fixed calendar tooltip showing wrong time (UTC parse bug → now uses local time parts)
- [x] Confirmed Rep Platform and Contact Rep button working end-to-end
- [x] Completed CALENDAR_ENCRYPTION_FIX_PLAN.md — all 3 phases done

## Completed This Session (2026-02-10)
- [x] Fixed Contact Rep button not showing (loadCompanies was filtering by subspecialty — removed filter, now loads all active companies)
- [x] Fixed onboarding flash on login (added profileLoaded gate so onboarding check waits for full profile from DB)
- [x] Fixed website showing all subspecialties' resources on login (gated loadAllData on profileLoaded; resources + categories now load in parallel)
- [x] Fixed scroll/re-render on tab switch (added deep-compare in loadUserProfile to skip setCurrentUser if profile data unchanged)
- [x] Fixed Admin Add Resource specialty/subspecialty not prepopulated (removed isInitialLoad ref guard so useEffects always fire)
